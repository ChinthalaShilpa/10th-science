## MASS AND WEIGHT


Mass: Mass is the basic property of a body. Mass of a body is defined as the quantity of matter contained in the body. Its SI unit is kilogram (kg).

Weight: Weight of a body is defined as the gravitational force exerted on a body due to the gravity.

Weight = Gravitational Force = mass (m)× acceleration due to

gravity(g). g = acceleration due to gravity for Earth

(at sea level) = 9.8 m_s_–2. Weight is a vector quantity. Direction

of weight is always towards the centre of the Earth. SI unit of weight is newton (N). Weight of a body varies from one place to another place on the Earth since it depends on the acceleration due to gravity of the Earth (g) weight of a body is more at the poles than at the equatorial region.

The value of acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the moon is 1.625 ms–2.

This is about 0.1654 times the acceleration due to gravity of the Earth. If a person whose mass is 60 kg stands on the surface of Earth, his weight would be 588 N (W = mg = 60 × 9.8). If the same person goes to the surface of the Moon, he would weigh only 97.5 N (W = 60 × 1.625). But, his mass remains the same (60 kg) on both the Earth and the Moon.
