## FORCE AND MOTION

According to Aristotle a Greek Philosopher and Scientist, the natural state of earthly bodies is ‘rest’. He stated that a moving body naturally comes to rest without any external influence of the force. Such motions are termed as **‘natural motion’ (Force independent).** He also proposed that a force (a push or a pull) is needed to make the bodies to move from their natural state (rest) and behave contrary to their own natural state called as **‘violent motion’ (Force dependent)**. Further, he said, when two differnt mass bodies are dropped from a height, the heavier body falls faster than the lighter one.

Galileo proposed the following concepts about force, motion and inertia of bodies:

(i) The natural state of all earthly bodies
is either the state of rest or the state of uniform motion.

(ii) A body in motion will continue to be in the same state of motion as long as no external force is applied.

(iii) When a force is applied on bodies, they resist any change in their state. This property of bodies is called ‘inertia’.

(iv) When dropped from a height in vacuum, bodies of different size, shape and mass fall at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time.
