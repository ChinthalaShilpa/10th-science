## APPARENT WEIGHT


The weight that you feel to possess during up and down motion, is not same as your actual weight. Apparent weight is the weight of the body acquired due to the action of gravity and other external forces acting on the body.

Let us see this from the following illustration:

Let us consider a person of mass m, who is travelling in lift. The actual weight of the person is W = mg, which is acting vertically downwards. The reaction force exerted by the **lift’s surface ‘R’, taken as apparent weight is** acting vertically upwards.

Let us see different possibilities of the apparent weight 'R' of the person that arise, depending on the motion of the lift; upwards or downwards which are given in Table 1.2

### Weightlessness


Have you gone to an amusement park and taken a ride in a roller coaster? or in a giant wheel? During the fast downward and upward movement, how did you feel?

_W_ **Figure 1.10**

A person in a moving lift








  


**Table 1.2 Apparent weight of a person in a moving lift**

Case 1: Lift is moving **upward** with an acceleration 'a'

Case 2: Lift is moving **downward** with an acceleration 'a'

Case 3: Lift is at rest. Case 4: Lift is falling down **freely**

R – W = Fnet = ma R = W + ma R = mg + ma **R = m(g+a)**

W – R = Fnet = ma R = W - ma R = mg - ma **R = m(g-a)**

Here, the acceleration is zero a = 0 R = W **R= mg**

Here, the acceleration is equal to g a = g **R = m(g – g)**

R > W R < W R = W R = 0 Apparent weight is **greater** than the actual weight.

Apparent weight is **lesser** than the actual weight.

Apparent weight is **equal** to the actual weight.

Apparent weight is equal to **zero**.

**Figure 1.11** Weightlessness in a roller coaster

Its amazing!!. You actually feel as if you are falling freely without having any weight. This is due to the phenomenon of ‘weightlessness’. You seem to have lost your weight when you move down with a certain acceleration. Sometimes, you experience the same feeling while travelling in a lift.

When the person in a lift moves down with an acceleration (a) equal to the acceleration due to gravity (g), i.e., when a = g, this motion is called as ‘_free fall_’. Here, the apparent weight (R = m (g – g) = 0) of the person is zero. This condition or state refers to the state of weightlessness. (Refer case 4 from Table 1.2).

The same effect takes place while falling freely in a roller coaster or on a swing or in a vertical giant wheel. You feel an apparent weight

loss and weight gain when you are moving up and down in such rides.

### Weightlessness of the astronauts


Some of us believe that the astronauts in the orbiting spacestation do not experience any gravitational force of the Earth. So they float. But this is absolutely wrong.

Astronauts are not floating but falling freely around the earth due to their huge oribital velocity. Since spacestation and astronauts have equal acceleration, they are under free fall condition. (R = 0 refer case 4 in Table 1.2). Hence, both the astronauts and the spacestation are in the state of weightlessness.

### Application of Newton’s law of gravitation


1) Dimensions of the heavenly bodies can be measured using the gravitation law. Mass of the Earth, radius of the Earth, acceleration due to gravity, etc. can be calculated with a higher accuracy.

2) Helps in discovering new stars and planets. 3) One of the irregularities in the motion

of stars is called ‘Wobble’ lead to the disturbance in the motion of a planet nearby. In this condition the mass of the star can be calculated using the law of gravitation.

4) Helps to explain germination of roots is due to the property of geotropism which is the property of a root responding to the gravity.

5) Helps to predict the path of the astronomical bodies.

**Points to Remember**

- Mechanics is divided into statics and dynamics.

- Ability of a body to maintain its state of rest or motion is called Inertia.

- Moment of the couple is measured by the product of any one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between two forces.

- SI unit of force is newton (N). C.G.S unit is dyne.

- When a force F acts on a body for a period of time t, then the product of force and time is known as ‘impulse’.

- The unit of weight is newton or kg f - The weight of a body is more at the poles

than at the equatorial region. - Mass of a body is defined as the quantity of

matter contained in the object. Its SI unit is kilogram (kg).

- Apparent weight is the weight of the body acquired due to the action of gravity and other external forces on the body.

- Whenever a body or a person falls freely under the action of Earth’s gravitational force alone, it appears to have zero weight. This state is referred to as ‘weightlessness’.

**SOLVED PROBLEMS Problem-1:** Calculate the velocity of a moving body of mass 5 kg whose linear momentum is 2.5 _kg_ _m_ _s_–1.

**Solution:** Linear momentum = mass × velocity

Velocity = linear momentum / mass. V = 2.5 / 5 = 0.5 _ms_–1

**Problem 2:** A door is pushed, at a point whose distance from the hinges is 90 cm, with a force of 40 N. Calculate the moment of the force about the hinges.

**Solution:**

**Formula: The moment of a force M = F × d**

Given: F = 40 N and d = 90 cm = 0.9 m.

Hence, moment of the force = 40 × 0.9 = 36 N m.

**Problem 3 :** At what height from the centre of the Earth the acceleration due to gravity will be 1/4th of its value as at the Earth.

**Solution: Data:** Height from the centre of the Earth, Rʹ = R + h The acceleration due to gravity at that height, gʹ = g/4

**Formula:** g = GM /R2, gʹ = GM /Rʹ2

g gʹ

2 = R+h

2 = 1 + h R

or h = R. Rʹ = 2R

From the centre of the Earth, the object is placed at twice the radius of the earth.
