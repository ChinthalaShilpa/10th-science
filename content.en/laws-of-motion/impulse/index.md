## Impulse

A large force acting for a very short interval of time is called as ‘**Impulsive force’**. When a force F acts on a body for a period of time t, then the product of force and time is known as ‘**impulse**’ represented by ‘J’

Impulse, J = F × t (1.7) By Newton’s second law F = Δp / t (Δ refers to change) Δp = F × t (1.8) From 1.7 and 1.8 **J = Δp** Impulse is also equal to the magnitude of change in momentum. Its unit is kgm_s_–1 or Ns. Change in momentum can be achieved in two ways. They are: i. a large force acting for a short period of
time and ii. a smaller force acting for a longer period
of time.

**Examples:**

- Automobiles are fitted with springs and shock absorbers to reduce jerks while moving on uneven roads.

- In cricket, a fielder pulls back his hands while catching the ball. He experiences a smaller force for a longer interval of time to catch the ball, resulting in a lesser impulse on his hands.
