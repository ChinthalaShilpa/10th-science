## PRINCIPLE OF CONSERVATION OF LINEAR MOMENTUM

There is no change in the linear momentum of a system of bodies as long as no net external force acts on them.

Let us prove the law of conservation of linear momentum with the following illustration:

**Proof:** Let two bodies A and B having masses

m1 and m2 move with initial velocity u1 and u2 in a straight line. Let the velocity of the first body be higher than that of the second body. i.e., u1>u2. During an interval of time t second, they tend to have a collision. After the impact, both of them move along the same straight line with a velocity v1 and v2 respectively.

Force on body B due to A, FA= m2 (v2–u2)/t Force on body A due to B, FB = m1 (v1–u1)/t

By Newton’s III law of motion, Action force = Reaction force FB = –FA m1 (v1-u1)/t = –m2 (v2-u2)/t

**m1v1 + m2v2 = m1u1 + m2u2 ------ (1.9)**

The above equation confirms in the **absence of an external force, the algebraic sum of the momentum after collision is numerically equal to sum of the momentum before collision.**

Hence the law of conservation linear momentum is proved.
