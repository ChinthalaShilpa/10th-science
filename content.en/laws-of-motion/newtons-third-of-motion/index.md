## NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION

Newton’s third law states that **‘for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. They always act on two different bodies’.**

If a body A applies a force FA on a body B, then the body B reacts with force FB on the body A, which is equal to FA in magnitude, but opposite in direction. FB = –FA

**Examples:**

- When birds fly they push the air downwards with their wings (Action) and the air pushes the bird upwards (Reaction).

- When a person swims he pushes the water using the hands backwards (Action), and the water pushes the swimmer in the forward direction (Reaction).

- When you fire a bullet, the gun recoils backward and the bullet is moving forward (Action) and the gun equalises this forward action by moving backward (Reaction).
